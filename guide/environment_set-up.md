# Initial Set-up

1. Install Visual Studio Code if you haven't already
2. Install Git, and config the GitHub extension under Source Control in Visual Studio Code by logging into the same GitHub account under which I have shared the repository to you (i.e. https://github.com/martin-he543/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction-kaggle-2022)
3. Sending your GitHub username so I can add you as a collaborator to this shared repository
4. Making sure you have also configured your GitHub extension in the VSCode Terminal (this can be done also using Windows CMD or Mac Terminal) - show the terminal in VSCode by typing: Ctrl + `
5. In the terminal, type the following two commands which I have also posted in the Slack channel:
`git config --global user.name "GITHUB USERNAME"`
`git config --global user.email "GITHUB EMAIL"`
It is very important you do this step and do it correctly using the right usernames and e-mails as this will make merge conflicts so much easier to sort.
6. Once you have set up GitHub, clone the GitHub repository. To do this, star the repository I have created and then create a new VSCode window, and select the new option: "Clone Git Repository". Then select the correct repository, and a location on your computer to save it in.
7. Once this has been done, everything should be working in order and you should be able to view the files locally. Make sure you're in your own personal branch, and not the master. To do this, check the bottom left corner and click the "Branch" icon and change to your name. If this doesn't appear, restart VSCode.
8. Make a demo change to your branch, then push it to GitHub. To do this, click on Source Control and type a commit message in the textbox - make sure to make this descriptive in case you need to go back to a previous commit "version". 
9. Push and Sync, this change, then check if you can see it online on GitHub on your branch.
10. If you have any GitHub issues, ask `@Hiroki-san Kozuki` or myself, or maybe `@Rub√©n Moreno Aguado` , and also for Markdown, check a Markdown cheat sheet online.
